# Titanic-Classification
Titanic Survival Classication Project
# Description
Welcome to the Titanic Survival Classification Project! This project focuses on predicting the survival outcomes of passengers aboard the Titanic. Whether you're interested in data analysis, machine learning, or want to explore historical events, this project provides insights into predictive modeling and data science.
# Key Features
1. Data Exploration: We explore the Titanic dataset, containing information about passengers' age, gender, class, cabin, and more. Data visualization techniques are used to gain insights.
2. Data Preprocessing: Data cleaning and preprocessing are crucial to handle missing values and prepare the dataset for machine learning algorithms.
3. Feature Engineering: We create new features or transform existing ones to enhance model performance.
4. Model Building: We build classification models, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting, to predict passenger survival.
5. Model Evaluation: Various evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, are used to assess model performance.
6. Cross-Validation: We employ techniques like k-fold cross-validation to ensure robust model performance and avoid overfitting.
7. Visualization: Results and insights are presented through interactive visualizations and charts.
